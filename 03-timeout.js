Write a function called navigator that takes in an array of
directions, prints the direction, then waits a specified amount
of time before moving to the next one. Your function should use
string interpolation to log something to the effect of 

Moving <direction>, waiting <delay>ms

North = 250ms
South = 125ms
East = 300ms
West = 175ms
